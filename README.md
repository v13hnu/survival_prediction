# survival_prediction

A machine learning program to predict the survival chance of passengers on Titanic ship. The idea is taken from one of the competition in Kaggle, Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster. Used Jupyter Notebook to wrtie this program. The goal of this program is to familiarize with supervised machine learning techniques and to find the best model for the titanic dataset.
